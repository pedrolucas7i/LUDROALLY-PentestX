**LUDROALLY** is a portable computer disguised as a handheld gaming console, specifically designed for pentesting and graphical interface environments. It provides an inconspicuous and highly portable solution for penetration testers, security researchers, or anyone in need of a stealthy computing device. The system is based on Kali Linux, offering the full range of tools and flexibility associated with one of the best-known penetration testing operating systems.

## Features
- **Disguised Console Design**: Designed to look like a gaming console, offering a stealthy and portable computing experience.
- **Built for Pentesting**: With Kali Linux installed, loaded with powerful tools for ethical hacking, security research, and network testing.
- **Graphical Environment Support**: Ideal for environments that require graphical user interfaces alongside terminal-based operations.
- **Lightweight and Portable**: Carry it anywhere, work from anywhere. Built for mobility.

## OS VERSIONS
Downloadable **tested images** of the **LUDROALLY** operating system based on versions of Kali Linux with all configuration and scripts can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/pedrolucas7i/LUDROALLY/releases) section.

### Current OS Version

- **Kali Linux** (Base OS)
  - Version: `2024.2`
  - Custom tweaks to eliminate the need for a keyboard and mouse, LCD Driver installed and configured.

### Download & Installation
To get started with **LUDROALLY**:
1. **Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/pedrolucas7i/LUDROALLY/releases) section and download the latest image.**
2. **Use a tool like `Balena Etcher` to flash the image onto an SD card.**
3. **Insert the storage medium into your LUDROALLY console and boot up!**

## Hardware Components
**LUDROALLY** is built using the following key hardware components:
- **Raspberry Pi**: A small, affordable computer that powers the device.
  - Suported Devices:
    - Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
    - Raspberry Pi 5 8GB (in Future)
- **Raspberry Pi 3.5-inch Display**: A small touchscreen that acts as the primary display for the console.
  - Resolution: 480x320 pixels
  - Interface: GPIO connection
  - SKU: MPI3501
  - LCD Type: TFT
  - LCD Interface: SPI
  - Driver IC: ILI9486
  - Touch Screen Controller: XPT2046
  - Colors: 65536
- **Custom Button Matrix**: An array of physical buttons configured for quick access to specific tools and commands.

These components together form a compact, portable, and versatile pentesting machine.

## Button Matrix Functionality
One of the unique features of LUDROALLY is the integration of a **button matrix** for control, interaction, and shortcut commands. Thus leaving more GPIOs for other functions.

### How It Works
The button matrix uses physical buttons arranged in rows and columns. Each button press is mapped to a specific function, such as moving the mouse, clicking, or triggering keyboard shortcuts, volume up and down. The matrix layout consists of 3 rows and 4 columns, with each button performing a unique action based on its position in the grid.
